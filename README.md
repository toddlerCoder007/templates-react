# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. Git hooks are set up using `husky`, and `lint-staged` is used to run linters on staged files before commits.


## Quick Start

1. Install packages and git hooks.
```
npm i
```

2. Start up the application. It will be accessible at http://localhost:5173/.
```
npm run dev
```

### Other useful scripts
To run lint,
```
npm run lint
```

To run e2e tests with Playwright,
```
npm run test:e2e:ci // without gui
npm run test:e2e // with gui
```

To build the application,
```
npm run build
```

To preview the built application,
```
npm run preview
```
